I realize that most of my projects are in C languages, but I find them rewarding to work with
Since you can see nearly all the moving parts, it becomes easier to contemplate what the code
is doing.  C languages facilitate more than just simple speed.  They allow for a deeper meditation
on the code, and for more satisfaction when the code works.
I apologize for the terminal UIs, I've been mostly concerned with the moving parts and 
interesting snippets of code I've had the ability to use.

Besides, if you can do it in C/C++, you can do it in any language, and isn't that 
the point?
