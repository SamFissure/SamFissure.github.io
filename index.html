<pre style="font-family:times;font-size: 134%;"> For now, this page will be about goofing off with HTML.  
At some point in the near future it will morph into a page about app development and progress.
At that point this text will disappear. 
(using "pre" tag for this paragraph and the font-family, as well as the font-size {134%} attributes.  
I am additionally using comments below {not visible} and a metadata title)</pre>
